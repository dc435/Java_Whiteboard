This file documents all the discovered faults in order to fix them

1. Scenario: Two users connect to server and using WB1 to draw. Both clients have drawn something on the WB1. Manager boots user2
   issue: After user2 create a new wb, it demonstrates the old graphics he drew on WB1

   NOTE: Investigation needed.

2. Save button is not activated in all states
3. Open and New buttons are only for manager according to spec. (New, Open, Save, SaveAs, Close)
4. Is the user identified uniquely on the server side? by unique id or unique name?

   NOTE: Just want to double check this. Current implementation is by name from my test.

5. Exception in thread "Appkit thread" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: accessibilityHitTest appears when I create third user

   NOTE: This is a BIG BOSS. I think this is from GUI and will cause some functions to crash.
   Such as user name not displayed for users, previous graphics change color when a new triangle is drawn.

   Understanding: From stack overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70112706/java-lang-nosuchmethoderror-accessibilityhittest)
   This seems to be a macbook issue, but they should have patched it. This was also an issue when I first started making GUI.
   Magically, it disappeared when I finished most of the functionalities in GUI?!! MORE TEST NEEDED.

   Issues after above exception shown:
    5.1 user name doesn't appear
    5.2 color changes
